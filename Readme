This an early version of the git-info LaTeX package, not yet suitable for
distribution on the CTAN, but maybe still usable.  Currently, there is only one
feature and no documentation besides this readme.

The feature is, if you load git-info in a document lying in a git repository,
the package defines a few macros containing information about the current HEAD:
- hash, committer and date of the last commit,
- current branch.
See the test file for the full list of macros available.

Git-info works by parsing some plain-text files in the git repository in pure
TeX.  There is currently some restrictions : the current HEAD must be a branch,
not detached; and probably other restrictions I am not aware of, due to my poor
knowledge of git (internals).

Plans for the future are to allow access to the same information (except the
branch) individually for each file, à la svn-multi.  With current TeX, it can
probably not be done in TeX macros, since access to a few compressed files is
needed.  So a helper script will be provided, intended to be run by the
post-commit hook, writing the necessary information to a plain text file.

Other plans for the future also include more testing, some customisation options,
and a proper documentation, of course.

Feel free to test the package, report features and suggest new bugs ;-)

Happy TeXing!
